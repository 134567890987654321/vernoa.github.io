                <h2>1. Magnetic Flux</h2>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The measure of magnetic field passing through a surface.</p>
                
                <div class="formula-box panel panel--orange">
                    Φ = BA cos(θ)<br>
                    <br>
                    Φ = ∫B·dA (general form)
                </div>

                <h3>Parameters:</h3>
                <div class="parameter-list">
                    <p><strong>Φ</strong> = Magnetic flux (Wb or T⋅m²)</p>
                    <p><strong>B</strong> = Magnetic field strength (T)</p>
                    <p><strong>A</strong> = Area of surface (m²)</p>
                    <p><strong>θ</strong> = Angle between B and normal to surface</p>
                    <p><strong>Maximum flux when θ = 0° (field perpendicular to surface):</strong> Φ = BA</p>
                    <p><strong>Zero flux when θ = 90° (field parallel to surface):</strong> Φ = 0</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Example 1: Magnetic Flux Through a Loop</h3>
                <div class="example-box panel panel--green">
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> A square loop with area 0.04 m² is placed in a uniform magnetic field of 0.5 T. The field makes an angle of 30° with the normal to the loop. What is the magnetic flux?
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                    Φ = BA cos(θ)<br>
                    Φ = (0.5 T)(0.04 m²) cos(30°)<br>
                    Φ = (0.02)(0.866)<br>
                    Φ = 0.0173 Wb ≈ 17.3 mWb<br>
                    <br>
                    The magnetic flux through the loop is about 17.3 millwebers.

                <h2>2. Faraday's Law of Induction</h2>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A changing magnetic flux through a loop induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the loop.</p>
                
                <div class="law-box">
                    ε = -dΦ/dt<br>
                    <br>
                    (The induced EMF equals the negative rate of change of magnetic flux)
                </div>

                <h3>Key Points:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>EMF is induced whenever magnetic flux through the loop changes</li>
                    <li>The negative sign indicates the direction (related to Lenz's Law)</li>
                    <li>Flux can change by: changing B, changing A, or changing angle θ</li>
                    <li>Larger rate of change → Larger induced EMF</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>For a Coil with N Turns:</h3>
                <div class="formula-box panel panel--orange">
                    ε = -N(dΦ/dt)
                </div>

                <h3>Example 2: Induced EMF from Changing Flux</h3>
                <div class="example-box panel panel--green">
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> A circular loop has an area of 0.1 m². The magnetic field through it changes from 0.2 T to 0.8 T in 0.5 seconds. What is the average induced EMF?
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                    ε = -dΦ/dt = -A(dB/dt)<br>
                    <br>
                    ΔB = 0.8 - 0.2 = 0.6 T<br>
                    Δt = 0.5 s<br>
                    dB/dt = 0.6 / 0.5 = 1.2 T/s<br>
                    <br>
                    ε = -(0.1 m²)(1.2 T/s) = -0.12 V<br>
                    <br>
                    The magnitude of induced EMF is 0.12 V.
                </div>

                <h3>Example 3: Coil with Multiple Turns</h3>
                <div class="example-box panel panel--green">
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> A coil with 50 turns, each with area 0.02 m², experiences a magnetic field change from 0 T to 0.4 T in 2 seconds. What is the induced EMF?
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                    ε = -N(dΦ/dt) = -N × A × (dB/dt)<br>
                    <br>
                    ε = -50 × 0.02 × (0.4 / 2)<br>
                    ε = -50 × 0.02 × 0.2<br>
                    ε = -0.2 V<br>
                    <br>
                    The magnitude of induced EMF is 0.2 V (50 times stronger than single loop due to N turns).

                <h2>3. Lenz's Law</h2>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The direction of the induced current is such that it opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.</p>
                
                <div class="law-box">
                    The induced current creates a magnetic field that OPPOSES the flux change causing it.
                </div>

                <h3>How to Apply Lenz's Law:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify whether external magnetic flux is increasing or decreasing</li>
                    <li>Determine the direction of external field</li>
                    <li>If flux is increasing: induced field opposes (points opposite direction)</li>
                    <li>If flux is decreasing: induced field reinforces (points same direction)</li>
                    <li>Use right-hand rule to find current direction from field direction</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Example 4: Lenz's Law - Increasing Flux</h3>
                <div class="example-box panel panel--green">
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> A magnet is pushed into a coil of wire. The north pole enters first. Using Lenz's Law, determine the direction of the induced current in the coil.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                    1. The magnetic flux through the coil is INCREASING (magnet entering)<br>
                    2. External field points OUT of north pole (toward coil)<br>
                    3. Induced current must create field pointing OPPOSITE (back toward magnet)<br>
                    4. Induced field points INTO the coil (away from us, if looking at near side)<br>
                    5. By right-hand rule: current flows CLOCKWISE (when viewed from magnet's perspective)<br>
                    <br>
                    The induced current creates a magnetic field that repels the incoming magnet (opposing the change).
                </div>

                <h3>Example 5: Lenz's Law - Decreasing Flux</h3>
                <div class="example-box panel panel--green">
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> A magnet is pulled away from a coil. Using Lenz's Law, determine the direction of the induced current.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                    1. The magnetic flux through the coil is DECREASING (magnet leaving)<br>
                    2. External field points OUT of north pole<br>
                    3. Induced current must create field pointing SAME direction (to replace lost flux)<br>
                    4. Induced field points OUT of coil<br>
                    5. By right-hand rule: current flows COUNTERCLOCKWISE (when viewed from magnet)<br>
                    <br>
                    The induced current creates a magnetic field that attracts the departing magnet (opposing the change).

                <ul>
                    <li>Moving conductor carries charges through magnetic field</li>
                    <li>Lorentz force separates charges: positive and negative</li>
                    <li>Charge separation creates potential difference (EMF)</li>
                    <li>One end becomes positive, other becomes negative</li>
                </ul>

                    <strong>Solution:</strong><br>

                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When current in a coil changes, the coil creates a changing magnetic field that induces an EMF opposing the change (self-induced EMF).</p>

                <h3>Example 10: Self-Induced EMF</h3>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> A solenoid with inductance 0.5 H experiences a current change from 0 A to 10 A in 0.2 seconds. What is the self-induced EMF?
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                    ε = -L(dI/dt)<br>
                    ε = -(0.5 H)(10 A / 0.2 s)<br>
                    ε = -(0.5)(50)<br>
                    ε = -25 V<br>
                    <br>
                    The magnitude of self-induced EMF is 25 V, opposing the current change.

                    <strong>Motional EMF:</strong> Moving conductor through B field generates EMF<br>
